‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps
Follow these steps to get your Learning Hub project up and running locally.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

`git clone https://github.com/EswariMaroju/OnlineLearningHub.git`
cd OnlineLearningHub
2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the backend directory, install dependencies, configure environment variables, and start the server.

Bash

```cd backend
npm install

```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT: The port your backend server will run on (e.g., 8000).
```

Once the .env file is set up, start the backend server:

Bash

```npm start
The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5173.
```

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.

Bash

```cd ../frontend # Go back to the root and then into frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend development server should now be running, usually on http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default).
```
